# AGMA Pose Estimator and Sequence Selector (AGMA-PESS)
Deep learning-based pose estimator and video sequence selector for infants GMA

AGMA-PESS is a python (PyQt5) based application developed to facilitate the selection of general movement sequences from videos in addition to infants' pose estimation. 

## How to run AGMA-PESS
Clone this repository and install the required packages listed in requirements.txt. Then, add the deep-learning model that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGAS2eWaF1dyXPgikYAqVs8DZwf2xiIJ/view?usp=sharing) inside "models" folder. Finally, run AGMA-PESS.py. 

### Tutorial
A video tutorial of AGMA-PESS is available online [here]()

### Installation file
Alternatively, you can download the installation .exe file for Windows operating systems directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y_ReeJUFWt6_V1KUSRPFYD27L-47NB5C/view?usp=sharing). 
 

Currently, there is no updated version of AGMA-PESS for Mac or Linux.
