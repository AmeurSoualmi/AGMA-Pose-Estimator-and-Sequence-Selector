# AGMA Pose Estimator and Sequence Selector (AGMA-PESS)
Deep learning based pose estimator and video sequence selector for infants GMA

AGMA-PESS is a python (PyQt5) based application developed to facilitate the selection of general movements sequences from videos in addition to infants' pose estimation . 

## How to run AGMA-PESS
Clone this repository and install the required packages listed in requirements.txt. Then, add the deep-learning model that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGAS2eWaF1dyXPgikYAqVs8DZwf2xiIJ/view?usp=sharing) inside "models" folder. Finally, run AGMA-PESS.py. 

### Tutorial
A video tutorial of AGMA-PESS is avaliable online [here]()

### Instalation file:
Alternatively, you can download directly the installation .exe file for Windows operating systems, from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QungTu7_TwrRZ1hGrLD1QVRcI4ZF3g0O/view?usp=sharing). 
 

Currently there is no updated version of AGMA-PESS for Mac or Linux.
